# VGA - Video game archives

Started as a assignment at cme "assingment 4"
And then I continued to work on it, currently doing a new version of this

## Using RAWG API to fetch data of video games

:D I choose to use vanilla js and fetch
instead of jquery, this project might continue to be pure vanilla js, 

I also done a gitignore so keys wont be visible or uploaded to github, i will send the key files  when handing in the project
or if I will host it, there will be a demo

### Api calls fetching and todo list

- api calls fetching data (works)
- search function (works)
- pagination (working on it, not easy)
- styling page (done)
- header, nav, footer (done)
- maybe connect with an externatl api to get trailers/ videos of each item (will do in new project)

### Data ?
I´ve tested several different ways to fetch data and show it in the dom,
to just get the data is not hard and show it as it is, 
pagination thou I have struggled with but I´m solving it (have solved it)

## ON this page you can see top games fo past year, recommended games, top games past 12 years, and search for games
