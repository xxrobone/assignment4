# API CALLS assignment 4

both pre work and will use same repo for the assingment 4
I heared we are working on apiÂ´s so I tested a little bit on my own this weekend ;D

## fetching data and getting it out on the dom

:D I choose to use vanilla js and fetch
instead of jquery, this project might continue to be pure vanilla js, 

I also done a gitignore so keys wont be visible or uploaded to github, i will send the key files  when handing in the project
or if I will host it, there will be a demo

### first one is fetching data from github

### second one is fethcing from the api shared by Rob(teacher)

api is chosen
next up
- pagination
- styling page
- header, nav, footer
- maybe connect with an externatl api to get trailers/ videos of each item
